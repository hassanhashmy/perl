.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This class implements a regex-based \s-1RFC 2822\s0 parser that locates email
addresses in strings and returns a list of \f(CW\*(C`Email::Address\*(C'\fR objects found.
Alternatively you may construct objects manually. The goal of this software is
to be correct, and very very fast.
.SS "Package Variables"
.IX Subsection "Package Variables"
\&\fB\s-1ACHTUNG\s0!\fR  Email isn't easy (if even possible) to parse with a regex, \fIat
least\fR if you're on a \f(CW\*(C`perl\*(C'\fR prior to 5.10.0.  Providing regular expressions
for use by other programs isn't a great idea, because it makes it hard to
improve the parser without breaking the \*(L"it's a regex\*(R" feature.  Using these
regular expressions is not encouraged, and methods like \f(CW\*(C`Email::Address\->is_addr_spec\*(C'\fR should be provided in the future.
.PP
Several regular expressions used in this package are useful to others.
For convenience, these variables are declared as package variables that
you may access from your program.
.PP
These regular expressions conform to the rules specified in \s-1RFC 2822.\s0
.PP
You can access these variables using the full namespace. If you want
short names, define them yourself.

.el .IP "\f(CW$Email::Address::addr_spec\fR" 4
.IX Item "$Email::Address::addr_spec"
This regular expression defined what an email address is allowed to
look like.
.ie n .IP "$Email::Address::angle_addr" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$Email::Address::angle_addr\fR" 4
.IX Item "$Email::Address::angle_addr"
This regular expression defines an \f(CW$addr_spec\fR wrapped in angle
brackets.
.ie n .IP "$Email::Address::name_addr" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$Email::Address::name_addr\fR" 4
.IX Item "$Email::Address::name_addr"
This regular expression defines what an email address can look like
with an optional preceding display name, also known as the \f(CW\*(C`phrase\*(C'\fR.
.ie n .IP "$Email::Address::mailbox" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$Email::Address::mailbox\fR" 4
.IX Item "$Email::Address::mailbox"
This is the complete regular expression defining an \s-1RFC 2822\s0 email
address with an optional preceding display name and optional
following comment.

.IX Item "parse"
.Vb 3
\&  my @addrs = Email::Address\->parse(
\&    q[me@local, Casey <me@local>, "Casey" <me@local> (West)]
\&  );
.Ve
.Sp
This method returns a list of \f(CW\*(C`Email::Address\*(C'\fR objects it finds in the input
string.  \fBPlease note\fR that it returns a list, and expects that it may find
multiple addresses.  The behavior in scalar context is undefined.
.Sp
The specification for an email address allows for infinitely nestable comments.
That's nice in theory, but a little over done.  By default this module allows
for one (\f(CW1\fR) level of nested comments. If you think you need more, modify the
\&\f(CW$Email::Address::COMMENT_NEST_LEVEL\fR package variable to allow more.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  $Email::Address::COMMENT_NEST_LEVEL = 10; # I\*(Aqm deep
.Ve
.Sp
The reason for this hardly-limiting limitation is simple: efficiency.
.Sp
Long strings of whitespace can be problematic for this module to parse, a bug
which has not yet been adequately addressed.  The default behavior is now to
collapse multiple spaces into a single space, which avoids this problem.  To
prevent this behavior, set \f(CW$Email::Address::COLLAPSE_SPACES\fR to zero.  This
variable will go away when the bug is resolved properly.
.Sp
In accordance with \s-1RFC 822\s0 and its descendants, this module demands that email
addresses be \s-1ASCII\s0 only.  Any non-ASCII content in the parsed addresses will
cause the parser to return no results.
.IP "new" 4
.IX Item "new"
.Vb 3
\&  my $address = Email::Address\->new(undef, \*(Aqcasey@local\*(Aq);
\&  my $address = Email::Address\->new(\*(AqCasey West\*(Aq, \*(Aqcasey@local\*(Aq);
\&  my $address = Email::Address\->new(undef, \*(Aqcasey@local\*(Aq, \*(Aq(Casey)\*(Aq);
.Ve
.Sp
Constructs and returns a new \f(CW\*(C`Email::Address\*(C'\fR object. Takes four
positional arguments: phrase, email, and comment, and original string.
.Sp
The original string should only really be set using \f(CW\*(C`parse\*(C'\fR.
.IP "purge_cache" 4
.IX Item "purge_cache"
.Vb 1
\&  Email::Address\->purge_cache;
.Ve
.Sp
One way this module stays fast is with internal caches. Caches live
in memory and there is the remote possibility that you will have a
memory problem. On the off chance that you think you're one of those
people, this class method will empty those caches.
.Sp
I've loaded over 12000 objects and not encountered a memory problem.

.Vb 1
\&  Email::Address\->disable_cache if memory_low();

If you'd rather not cache address parses at all, you can disable (and
re-enable) the Email::Address cache with these methods.  The cache is enabled
by default.

Accessor for the host portion of an address's address.

Accessor for the user portion of an address's address.

.IX Item "format"
.Vb 1
\&  my $printable = $address\->format;

Returns a properly formatted \s-1RFC 2822\s0 address representing the
object.
.IP "name" 4
.IX Item "name"
.Vb 1
\&  my $name = $address\->name;
.Ve
.Sp
This method tries very hard to determine the name belonging to the address.
First the \f(CW\*(C`phrase\*(C'\fR is checked. If that doesn't work out the \f(CW\*(C`comment\*(C'\fR
is looked into. If that still doesn't work out, the \f(CW\*(C`user\*(C'\fR portion of
the \f(CW\*(C`address\*(C'\fR is returned.
.Sp
This method does \fBnot\fR try to massage any name it identifies and instead
leaves that up to someone else. Who is it to decide if someone wants their
name capitalized, or if they're Irish?

.IX Item "stringify"
.Vb 1
\&  print "I have your email address, $address.";
.Ve
.Sp
Objects stringify to \f(CW\*(C`format\*(C'\fR by default. It's possible that you don't
like that idea. Okay, then, you can change it by modifying
\&\f(CW$Email:Address::STRINGIFY\fR. Please consider modifying this package
variable using \f(CW\*(C`local\*(C'\fR. You might step on someone else's toes if you
don't.
.Sp
.Vb 7
\&  {
\&    local $Email::Address::STRINGIFY = \*(Aqhost\*(Aq;
\&    print "I have your address, $address.";

\&  }
\&  print "I have your address, $address.";
\&  #   "Casey West" <casey@geeknest.com>
.Ve
.Sp
Modifying this package variable is now deprecated. Subclassing is now the
recommended approach.
