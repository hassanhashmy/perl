=head1 NAME

PPIx::Regexp::Node::Range - Represent a character range in a character class

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use PPIx::Regexp::Dumper;
 PPIx::Regexp::Dumper->new( 'qr{[a-z]}smx' )
     ->print();

=head1 INHERITANCE

C<PPIx::Regexp::Node::Range> is a
L<PPIx::Regexp::Node|PPIx::Regexp::Node>.

C<PPIx::Regexp::Node::Range> has no descendants.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents a character range in a character class. It is a
node rather than a structure because there are no delimiters. The
content is simply the two literals with the '-' operator between them.

=head1 METHODS

This class provides no public methods beyond those provided by its
superclass.
