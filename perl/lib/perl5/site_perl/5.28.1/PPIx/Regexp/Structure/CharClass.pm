 $class->negated() and print "Class is negated\n";

This method returns true if the character class is negated -- that is,
if the first token inside the left square bracket is a caret (C<^>).

    my ( $self ) = @_;
    return $self->type() ? 1 : 0;

# Called by the lexer to record the capture number.
