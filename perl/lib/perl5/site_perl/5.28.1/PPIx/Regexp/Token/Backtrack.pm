=head2 arg

This method returns the backtrack control argument specified by the
element. This is the text after the first colon (C<':'>), or the empty
string (C<''>) if none was specified.

=cut

    sub arg {
	my ( $self ) = @_;
	my $content = $self->content();
	$content =~ s/ [^:]* //smx;	# (
	$content =~ s/ \) //smx;
	return $content;
    }

=head2 verb

This method returns the backtrack control verb represented by the
element. This is the text up to but not including the first colon
(C<':'>) if any. If the element specifies C<''> or C<'F">, this method
will return C<'MARK'> or C<'FAIL'>, respectively.

    sub verb {
	my ( $self ) = @_;
	my $content = $self->content();
	$content =~ s/ \( \* //smx;
	$content =~ s/ [:)] .* //smx;
	defined( my $syn = $synonym{$content} )
	    or return $content;
	return $syn;
    }

# This must be implemented by tokens which do not recognize themselves.
# The return is a list of list references. Each list reference must
# contain a regular expression that recognizes the token, and optionally
# a reference to a hash to pass to make_token as the class-specific
# arguments. The regular expression MUST be anchored to the beginning of
# the string.

    return ( [ qr{ \A \( \* [^\)]* \) }smx ] );
}

# This class gets recognized by PPIx::Regexp::Token::Structure as part
# of its left parenthesis processing.
