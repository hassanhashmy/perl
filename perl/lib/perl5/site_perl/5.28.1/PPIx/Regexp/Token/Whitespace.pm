PPIx::Regexp::Token::Whitespace - Represent whitespace

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use PPIx::Regexp::Dumper;
 PPIx::Regexp::Dumper->new( 'qr{ foo }smx' )
     ->print();

=head1 INHERITANCE

C<PPIx::Regexp::Token::Whitespace> is a
L<PPIx::Regexp::NoOp|PPIx::Regexp::NoOp>.

C<PPIx::Regexp::Token::Whitespace> has no descendants.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents whitespace. It will appear inside the regular
expression only if the C</x> modifier is present, but it may also appear
between the type and the opening delimiter (e.g. C<qr {foo}>) or after
the regular expression in a bracketed substitution (e.g. C<s{foo}
{bar}>).

If the C</xx> modifier is present, it can also appear inside bracketed
character classes. This was introduced in Perl 5.25.9.

=head1 METHODS

This class provides no public methods beyond those provided by its
superclass.
