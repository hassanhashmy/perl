=head1 NAME

PPIx::Regexp::Token::Assertion - Represent a simple assertion.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use PPIx::Regexp::Dumper;
 PPIx::Regexp::Dumper->new( 'qr{\bfoo\b}smx' )
     ->print();

=head1 INHERITANCE

C<PPIx::Regexp::Token::Assertion> is a
L<PPIx::Regexp::Token|PPIx::Regexp::Token>.

C<PPIx::Regexp::Token::Assertion> has no descendants.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents one of the simple assertions; that is, those that
are not defined via parentheses. This includes the zero-width assertions
C<^>, C<$>, C<\b>, C<\B>, C<\A>, C<\Z>, C<\z> and C<\G>, as well as:

=over

=item * The C<\z> assertion added in Perl 5.005,

=item * The C<\K> assertion added in Perl 5.009005,

=item * The C<\b{gcb}> assertion (and friends) added in Perl 5.021009.
Similar braced constructions (like C<\b{foo}>) are unknown tokens.

=head1 METHODS

This class provides no public methods beyond those provided by its
superclass.
