=head1 NAME

PPIx::Regexp::Token::Control - Case and quote control.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use PPIx::Regexp::Dumper;
 PPIx::Regexp::Dumper->new( 'qr{\Ufoo\E}smx' )
     ->print();

=head1 INHERITANCE

C<PPIx::Regexp::Token::Control> is a
L<PPIx::Regexp::Token|PPIx::Regexp::Token>.

C<PPIx::Regexp::Token::Control> has no descendants.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the case and quote controls. These apply when the
regular expression is compiled, changing the actual expression
generated. For example

 print qr{\Ufoo\E}, "\n"

prints

 (?-xism:FOO)

=head1 METHODS

This class provides no public methods beyond those provided by its
superclass.
